Developing
==========

This pipeline can be tested by running ``pytest``. `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org>`_ is used for linting.

We use `mypy <https://github.com/python/mypy>`_ for type checking. This can be run by running ``mypy src`` (this runs mypy on the ``src`` directory).

We use `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for code formatting.
